intro:
  - title: What is Playconomics?
    body: >-
      Playconomics is an award-winning Ed-tech platform developed at UNSW that weaves the videogame metaverse with standard university material to create online courses that motivate, influence, and inspire learning as a fun, engaging and rewarding journey. Its virtual world is shared by thousands of students, and it can persist and outlive the duration of a course. The goal of Playconomics is to create the most open-ended, multidisciplinary and fun teaching tool that ever existed.
  - title: How does it work?
    body: >-
      When a student joins Playconomics, they’re faced with a vast, persistent world that’s full of potential. They have the opportunity to construct a society from the ground up, and in doing so make decisions that are informed by the principles of economics, business, engineering, medicine, and more. Whether this virtual society stumbles on the same social and environmental issues we see in the real world is up to you. What follows is a troubleshooting exercise in social and technical engineering, where all fields come together in a truly interdisciplinary effort, driven by a common transparent language – Playconomics.
